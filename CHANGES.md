# AP Nonograms 0.7.1
## Release Notes
- While a Linux release is available, it is completely untested due to me not having a machine to test it with, if you're brave, give it a try!
- [Many features are still planned to be implemented](https://github.com/CommandTM/ap-nonograms?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap), be patient for more in the (hopefully near) future!

## New Features

## Improved Features
- Dragging an input no longer flips any cell it goes over, but persists what the input was for the first cell
- The text client can no longer send empty messages
- The text client window is now resizable
- The text client now has colored text to make it more readable
- The puzzle outlines are no longer black, making it easier to see the grid with a lot of filled in cells
