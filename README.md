# AP Nonograms
AP Nonograms is a special client for use with [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago). It allows you to solve various community made Nonograms to get hints in your game.

## Roadmap
### 0.7.1g
- Overall improvements to 0.7.0, no real new features, just helping the ease of use
### 0.7.2g
- Whenever you solve a puzzle, it will be removed from the rotation so you don't get it again
- Improve the process of grabbing the Nonograms from the puzzle bank
- Add an option for a "Max Puzzle Size" which will not allow puzzles above the user's set size to appear in the rotation
- Every 5 lines, a thicker line should be placed on the board's grid
### 0.8.0g
- Have puzzles in the rotation relate to the games in the multiworld, giving the client a personalizied experience
### 0.9.0g
- Have a system in place to incentivise solving more difficult puzzles, the exact method is still undecided
### 1.0.0g
- This release will mostly just be a version increment, once this project is merged into [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago), it'll move to 1.0.0g
